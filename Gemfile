# This is a gemfile. Gems are a name for Ruby/Rails libraries. Gemfiles are
# a way of easily keeping track of what libraries you are using, adding new gems
# and setting up groups of gems that you only want to use at certain times.

# In a gemfile, groups define what gems you want to use when. For example, 
# there are gems which make it easier to develop in rails, but you don't 
# necessarily want your app to load those Gems when your end users are using it
# (would probably slow it down).
