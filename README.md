# Faceebook
## The next big thing in social networking!

### Main features

Users can create a profile about themselves.
Users can post messages that all other users of the application can view.
Users can create events, and other users can view the details of the events.

### Educational Features

As a bonus feature, the code in faceebook is written to help people learn
to write code using the Ruby on Rails framework. Some of our code is **heavily** commented for teaching purposes.

Some files that have been commented with code/concept explanations are:

- models/user.rb
- migrate/20130330014710_create_events.rb
- minimal_posts_controller.rb
- Gemfile

### Our Utopian Vision for Social Networking

In Faceebook, all users can view each others postings and events. We discard
the concept of 'friends'. Everyone is friends on faceebook!

If you do not share our vision, we recommend you explore our competitor application, [fakebook, which has open source code available at this link](https://github.com/juliat/fakebook).
